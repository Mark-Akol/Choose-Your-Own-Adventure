#### Choose Your Own Adventure Game in Python
Welcome to the exciting world of Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) games written in Python! This README will guide you through the basics of creating your own interactive story where the reader controls the narrative.

#### What is a CYOA Game?

A CYOA game is a story where the reader makes choices at key points, determining the direction of the plot. Imagine reading a book where you're not just a passive observer,but an active participant who can influence the characters' decisions and ultimately reach different endings. That's the magic of CYOA!

##### Building Your Adventure

#### To create your CYOA game in Python, you'll need:

Basic Python knowledge: Understanding variables, conditional statements (if/else), and functions will be key.
A creative story: What's the world you want to build? Who are your characters? What kind of choices will they face?
Text editor: Any basic text editor like Notepad or Sublime Text will do.
